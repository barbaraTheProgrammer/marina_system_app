Marina yachts management application called Marineye.

Marineye system was intended for small marinas to automate their management, through a web application built in Laravel. The solution was planned for controlling up to fifty berths. 

System provided such fetures as:
+ Constant overview of the current situation of the marina, thanks to a graphically presented marina diagram.
+ Management of berths and their availability, allowing for the deactivation of berths, for example due to renovation or damage.
+ Control of marina traffic by keeping a record of visitor arrivals.
+ Keeping a record of the moored yachts and their captains.
+ Reservation system - Booking of berths and booking activation when the yacht arrives.
+ Marina archive - History of moored yachts with their captains and information on mooring location and duration of stay.

The application was written in PHP language in Laravel framework. MySQL was used to handle the database.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
